# The Basics of Kohanut

Every page has one or more **Element Areas**, which hold **Elements**.

Most elements use [Markdown](using.markdown) for their markup, which is much easier to use than HTML, especially for people who have never written websites before.  Using markdown is optional, and you can use regular HTML if you want.

Some elements, especially the layouts, use Twig, and the [Kohanut functions](using.kohanut) for doing more advanced things, like including stylesheets and laying out the pages.

I recommend that you [learn how to use Markdown](using.markdown), and then try [creating a page](using.pages).
